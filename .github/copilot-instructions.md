# Azure Excel Data Validation Agent

This project implements an intelligent Azure-based agent that processes Excel files, validates data, sends email notifications for corrections, and tracks changes.

## Architecture
- **Azure Functions**: Serverless execution for processing Excel files and validation
- **Azure AI Services**: Intelligent data validation and analysis using GPT models
- **Azure Communication Services**: Email notifications and lookups
- **Azure Storage**: State tracking and change validation
- **Azure Cosmos DB**: Metadata and tracking storage
